Hi! I'm Akshay 👋

I'm a Combined Major in Science student at UBC with a strong focus on data science, environmental analytics, and sustainable development.

🔍 I work on projects involving:
- Data analysis, modeling, and visualization (Python, SQL, Excel, Power BI)
- Environmental risk modeling and carbon benchmarking
- Research-driven insights and applied data for climate solutions

🌱 Recent Projects:
- [Forest Restoration Risk Scoring Model](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/forest-restoration-risk-model)
- [Carbon MRV Benchmarking Review](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/carbon-mrv-benchmarking)

📈 Currently exploring:
- Carbon monitoring systems and forest impact modeling
- Science-based approaches to sustainability and ESG
- Scalable tools for data-driven environmental decision-making

Always open to connecting with others working in climate tech, data science, or environmental policy!
