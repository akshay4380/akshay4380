👋 Hi, I'm Akshay Tripathi
I'm an undergraduate at the University of British Columbia pursuing a Combined Major in Science, focusing on Statistics, Environmental Science, and Physics. My work bridges data science and environmental sustainability, and I'm passionate about using open, intuitive tools to drive climate-positive decisions.

🌍 What I’m About
I believe that actionable environmental insights should be accessible to everyone—from policymakers to researchers to the general public. That belief drives my projects, which often sit at the intersection of climate science, data modeling, and interactive applications.

I specialize in:

Data analytics using Python, SQL, Power BI, and Excel

Environmental modeling for carbon monitoring, ecological risk, and LCA frameworks

Tool development for non-technical audiences using platforms like Streamlit

Scientific research and literature synthesis for climate policy support

🔬 Featured Projects
Forest Restoration Risk Scoring Model
A Python-based tool to quantify environmental vulnerability across reforestation sites using rainfall, slope, and erosion metrics. Built to support risk-aware decision-making in conservation planning.

Carbon MRV Benchmarking
A literature review and impact framework comparison exploring how monitoring, reporting, and verification methods vary across carbon programs. Synthesizes key insights to support methodological harmonization.

Customer Churn Prediction
Applied logistic regression to telecom data to predict customer retention patterns. Built dashboards with Power BI to interpret trends and guide strategy.

🛠 Technical Stack
Languages & Tools: Python, SQL, R, Power BI, Streamlit, Excel

Libraries: pandas, scikit-learn, Plotly, Matplotlib, Pint

Concepts: Life Cycle Assessment, Semantic Similarity, Allocation Methods, AI for Data Mapping

Collaboration: GitHub, Slack, JupyterHub, OneDrive

📚 Currently Exploring
Scalable platforms for hydrogen LCA modeling

Integrating AI-assisted mapping into environmental tools

Building user-friendly documentation and tutorials for open-access science

💡 I’m always interested in collaborating with others working in climate tech, environmental data science, or LCA tool development. Feel free to reach out or explore my pinned projects!
